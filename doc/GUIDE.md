Conventions:

  Atomic units are used wherein energies are in Ryd, lengths are in Bohr, and e^2 = 2 Ryd*Bohr.
  Calculations are always performed using periodic boundary conditions and Kohn-Sham functions
  (wave functions) are represented either on a real-space mesh or a reciprocal-space mesh. One
  representation can be transformed into the other via a Fourier transform and a wave function
  is normalized such that:

  sum(phi_i*conjg(phi_i)) = N, where the sum is over the N real-space mesh points in a periodic cell

  sum(phi_i*conjg(phi_i)) = 1, where the sum is over the reciprocal-space mesh points

  With these conventions, the real-space to reciprocal-space Fourier transform is scaled by 1/N.

Input and output files.

   Socorro requires a set of input files and a unix directory system, and produces a set of output
   files. The numbers of input and output files depend on the type of calculation being performed.
   The names of the input and output files can be customized by editing /socorro/src/path_mod.f90.
   With two exceptions, the names of the input and output directories can likewise be customized by
   editing /socorro/src/path_mod.f90. The exceptions are the control and interrupt files which must
   be located in the run directory. Brief descriptions of the default input and output files for a
   single configuration run are given below. For calculations with multiple configurations (e.g. dimer
   method), a configuration number (01, 02,...) is inserted after the input or output directory.

How to run a test calculation:

   To run the test in /socorro/testdata/si_ncp:
     # cd run
     # ./linktest si_ncp
     # ./socorro

Tips for dealing with symmetry problems.

    When there are not as many point-group symmetry operations as expected, check that the magnitudes of
    lattice vectors related by symmetry are equal to each other. If this is not possible, increase the
    number of digits in the lattice vectors to make the them equal to within 1.0e-8 Bohr (the tolerance
    used in symmetry_mod.f90).

Tips for dealing with electronic-structure convergence problems.

    When performing calculations using large supercells, it is not uncommon to encounter slow convergence of
    the electronic structure. When this occurs, try increasing the number of bands (nbands tag), increasing
    the number of solver directions (solver_directions tag), and using kerker weighting in the mixing algorithm
    (mix_weight_tp  tag). You may also try reducing the value of mix_weight_pf and lowering mix_weight_g to
    damp out oscillations in the electron density from one iteration to the next.

Tips for dealing with memory problems.

    When performing calculations for large numbers of atoms and/or large cutoffs, the memory requirements may
    exceed the amount of RAM resulting in poor performance due to swapping to disk or in a crash. The remedy
    for this is to reduce the size of the calculation by lowering the energy cutoff or increase the memory by
    increasing the number of processors. If the problem occurs in the decomposition of the Kohn-Sham functions,
    you can decrease the memory requirement by setting the dcomp_memory tag to s.

Tips when performing transition-state calculations.

    When performing a nudged-elastic-band calculation, it is necessary to null the residual atomic forces (the
    default) and it is necessary that the prior calculations to obtain the atomic structures at the end points
    also were performed with the residual forces nulled.

    When performing a dimer calculation, it is necessary to null the residual atomic forces (the default).

Tags and values used to control a run:

   The lines below explain tags and their associated values which can be used to control a Socorro calculation.  To
   use a tag, simply give it on a separate line in argvf followed by the tag value or values. For example, to specify
   a wavefunction cutoff of 20 Ryd add the following line to argvf:

   wf_cutoff  20.0d0

   Note that: Tags can be written with any combination of upper and lower case.
              Logical parameters can be written with any combination of upper and lower case.
              Character values can be written with any combination of upper and lower case.
              Energy values must be given in Rydberg units.
              Distances must be given in atomic units (Bohr radii).

   Tag descriptions are grouped according to code areas, and the format for the descriptions is as follows:

    tag: Meaning
        type; valid values or range of numerical values; default value
        modules where tag is sought; object where value is stored; name of variable holding the value
        first option if tag is not found, second option if tag is not found, ...
        Note #1
        Note #2
        .
        .
        .

Error handling related tags:

    error_file_mode: Determines how many error files to write.
        character; all, first, none; first
        sys_mod, tag ; error_mod, file_status, file_mode
        run aborts
        notes; all (the default) causes all processes to write error files (errorf_xxxx)
               first causes each rank 0 processes in an MPI CONFIG scope write an errof file (errorf)
               none causes no errorf files to be written

        character; GMP, GBP, USP; GMP
        kpoints_mod; kpoints_obj; kp%o%mode
        default is used
        For GMP (Generate Monkhorst Pack), a mesh is generated from mpparams (see below). These points are closed using the
           lattice group and then reduced using the point group of the space group (augmented with inversion if it is not
           already present in the space group).
        For GBP (Generate Baldereschi Point), the point at (0.25,0.25,0.25) is used for sampling. This mode  is meant to be
           used only in molecular dynamics calculations and only with a cubic cell and the C_1 space group.
        For USP (Read Special Points), sampling points are read from file /data/kpoints. The format is

        Values along two reciprocal lattice vectors related by a point group operation must be the same.
        The point at zero for a reciprocal lattice vector is included if the value for that vector is < 0.

ENERGY MINIMIZATION:

Fixed volume optimization of the atomic positions. All atoms are moved
- there is currently no method for constraining specific atoms. 
This is called by the statement "if (optimize_lattice(cfg)) call
diary(cfg)"  in socorro.f90.  
optimize_lattice returns a logical that indicates whether any
modifications to cfg have occurred.  The cfg that is returned
corresponds to the optimized positions.

The relevant options in argvf are as follows

relax_method: Specify the relaxation method to be used.

 NONE default Do not perform a structural optimization

 STEEPEST_DESCENTS, SD  'steepest descents' (I have seen
  different definitions of 'steepest descents'.) What is implemented
  here is the simple approach of changing the coordinates by             
  F*relax_prefactor where F is the current force and relax_prefactor 
  is a parameter that you can set (see below).  This is usually NOT 
  the best way to get to a minimum.  It was included because it was the 
  obvious first thing to code and is a standard 'brute force' approach to
  optimization.

 CONJUGATE_GRADIENT, CG  'conjugate gradients' 
  Implements a conjugate gradient search for the minimum
  energy structure.  (See Press, et.al, 'Numerical Recipes' for 
  a description of this algorithm.)  This is typically the best 
  way to go when the initial positions are close to the minimum.

 QUENCHED_MINIMIZATION, QM 'quenched MD'  
  This implements an algorithm described in Della Valle and Andersen, 
  J. Chem. Phys. 97, 2682 (1992).  It performs a molecular dynamics
  simulation using the 'velocity Verlet' algorithm with the following
  modifications.  At each time step and for each particle, the velocity 
  is reset as follows.  If the projection of the force along the velocity 
  is positive, the velocity is replaced by the projection of the velocity
  along the direction of the force.  If the projection is negative, the   
  velocity is set to zero. This will quench the dynamics to the minimum.   
  This approach seems to be best suited for getting close to the minimum   
  when the initial guess may be poor.

relax_tol:  This is the stopping criteria for all methods.  
  The code stops when the root mean square value of the force components is
  less than this value.  default: 1.d-3.

relax_steps:  This sets a maximum number of force calls that can be made to
  attempt to find the minimum.  Note that in some cases, the actual
  number of calls may exceed this slightly since it will always try
  to finish the line minimizations in the conjugate gradient
  approach.  default: 100

relax_prefactor: This is the constant used in relax_method=SD (see above)
  Note that the efficiency and stability of this method depends on this 
  choice.  If the value is too large, the optimization will become
  unstable.  If it is too small, a large number of force calls is
  required to get to the minimum.  default: 1.0

relax_time_step: This is used in relax_method=QM.  It sets the fixed time
  step for the MD simulation.  default: 1.0 (probably too small for most
  cases.)

atom_mass_xxx This is the mass of the atom in amu used for 
  quench_minimization.  Here xxx is replaced by the tag used in the 
  crystal file.  There should be one line like this for each type.  
  The default is to assume a mass of 1 amu.

        real number; 0 < md_hoover_mass; 1000.

    md_gen_velocities
        character; YES, NO; YES

The code can currently perform either a NVE (constant number,
volume and energy) micro-canonical simulation or a NVT (constant
number, volume and temperature) simulation.  For the later case, a
variety of standard thermostat methods are implemented.  The
initial velocities can be either read from the file
"data/initial_velocity" or are set randomly based on an input
temperature.  The integration is performed via the 'velocity
Verlet' algorithm (see any book on MD simulations) with a fixed
time step.  Intermediate atomic positions are output to the file
'md_output' at every time step.  The masses are set with the arg
parameter atom_mass_xxx (see below).

This is called by the statement "if (run_moldyn(cfg)) call
diary(cfg)" in socorro.f90.  run_moldyn returns a logical that
indicates whether any modifications to cfg have occurred.  If an
MD simulation is performed, the cfg returned is that for the final
time step.

The relevant parameters are

md_method: Specify the molecular dynamics method to be used.

 NONE (default) - do no MD.

 NVE perform a NVE simulation using a fixed time-step velocity
  Verlet algorithm.

 NVT_RESCALE perform a NVT (isochoric,isothermal) simulation using a 
  fixed time-step.  The temperature control is through periodic 
  rescaling of the velocities to achieve the desired temperature.

 NVT_ANDERSON perform a NVT (isochoric, isothermal) simulation using 
  a fixed time-step.  The temperature is controlled via a stochastic 
  method due to Anderson (see H C Anderson, J. Chem. Phys. 72, 2384
 (1980)).  At each time step and for each atom, a random velocity 
  from a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution replaces the velocity with a 
  probability give by 1/temp_freq.

 NVT_HOOVER perform a NVT (isochoric, isothermal) simulation using a 
  fixed time-step.  The temperature is controlled using the Hoover
  implementation of the Nos thermostat. (See, for example, 
  "Understanding Molecular Simulations" by Frenkel and Smit).  The 
  rate of energy flow between the ions and the heat bath is controlled 
  by md_hoover_mass.

md_time_step Time step used for the MD. See note below regarding units.   
  default: 100.

md_steps Number of time steps to integrate the equation of motion. 
  default: 0

md_skip_steps  Number of time steps to ignore before starting to 
  compute averages - in other words (skip_steps)*(time_step) is an 
  equilibration time.  default: 0

md_init_temp  Temperature used to define the initial velocity 
  distributions.  The velocities are selected from a Maxwell-Boltzman
  distribution.  Then they are adjusted to give zero total momentum 
  and rescaled to give the exact temperature requested. default: 0

md_desired_temp Target temperature for the isothermal simulation methods.
  default: md_init_temp

md_temp_freq Parameter that determines the frequency of velocity 
  modifications for the isothermal simulation methods.  For NVT\_RESCALE, 
  the velocity is rescaled every md\_temp\_freq time steps.  For 
  NVT\_ANDERSON, it give the inverse of the probability that an 
  atom will get a random velocity in a given time step.

atom_mass_xxx This is the mass of the atom in amu.  Here xxx is 
  replaced by the tag used in the crystal file.  There should be 
  one line like this for each type.  The default is to assume a 
  mass of 1 amu.

md_hoover_mass Used by NVT\_HOOVER. It is the effective mass 
  associated with the additional coordinate added to control the 
  temperature.  It may need to be adjusted by trial and error.  
  default: 1000.

md_gen_velocities  Specify the method for initializing velocities

 YES Determine the initial velocities based on md_init_temp.
  (default)

 NO Read the initial velocities from the file 'initial_velocity' in the 
  run directory.  This file contains a line with the x, y, and z 
  velocity for each atom on a separate line.  The order of the atoms 
  is assumed to be the same as in the crystal file.


NOTE ON UNITS:

The convention in the code is that energies are in Rydbergs and that 
distances are in Bohrs.  I have made the choice to have the code work 
with the nuclear masses in units of the electron mass - keep in the spirit
of atomic units. For convenience, when masses are entered, they are assumed
to be in amu (atomic mass units) and are converted in the code 
to electron masses.  Having made this choice for the mass unit, the choice 
of the time unit is now fixed.  The unit of time is 3.421E-17 sec.  Since 
a typical MD time step is on the order of a few femtoseconds (fs), 
the typical time steps will be on the order of 100 in the units used here.

There is a subtlety in the determination of the temperature.  In classical 
thermodynamics (MD is classical in the treatment of the ionic motion), 
each degree of freedom has a kinetic energy of kT/2. The issue is related to
the number of degrees of freedom.  If the MD method used conserves 
the total momentum, then the number of degrees of freedom is 3(N-1).  
If the total momentum is not conserved, the number of degrees of freedom 
is 3N.  The NVE and NVT_RESCALE methods conserve the total momentum.
(Actually, for NVT_RESCALE the total momentum remains zero if it starts 
out zero. The initial velocities are generated in the code to have
zero total momentum.)  For these methods, the code uses 3(N-1) degrees of
freedom to determine the temperature.  For NVT\_ANDERSON, the total 
momentum is not conserved, so the code uses 3N degrees of freedom to
compute the temperature.
